Returns every registered external-auth client. Client secrets are never returned by this route - they are shown exactly once at creation time by [Create external-auth client](/api/admin/external-auth-create/) and cannot be retrieved afterward.

See [External auth](/api/external-auth/) for the user-facing routes and [External apps](/admin/external-auth/) for the operator setup.
