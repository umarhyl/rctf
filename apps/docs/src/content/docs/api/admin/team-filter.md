::route-meta{def="FilterAdminUsersRouteV2"}

This route lists teams with richer filters than the GET route can carry comfortably. The query string still controls pagination, sorting, and text search.

Filter objects can include nullable `include` and `exclude` arrays. A field can be omitted when that filter does not apply.
