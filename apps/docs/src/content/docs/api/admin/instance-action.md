This route is the admin copy of `<route>POST /api/v2/integrations/challs/:id/instance/actions/:action</route>`. It runs a provider-defined action against the authenticated admin's own instance, and it also works for hidden challenges, challenges with a future `releaseTime`, and before the CTF starts.
