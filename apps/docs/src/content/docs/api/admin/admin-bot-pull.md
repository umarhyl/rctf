The admin bot worker calls this service route when it is ready for more work. It receives the oldest queued job. When nothing is waiting, the response has `job` set to `null{:ts}`.

The request is authenticated with the shared admin bot bearer token from `adminBot.provider.options.secretKey{:yaml}` in `rctf.d/{:dir}`.
