::route-meta{def="FilterAdminSubmissionsRouteV2"}

This route lists submission audit rows with richer filters. The query string still controls pagination, sorting, and lightweight text search.

Filter objects can include nullable `include` and `exclude` arrays. Date filters are parsed as ISO timestamps, and `createdAfter` needs to be earlier than `createdBefore` when both are provided.
