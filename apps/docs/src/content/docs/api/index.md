rCTF exposes a JSON REST API under `/api`. The `@rctf/types` package exports the route definitions and TypeScript types used by both the server and API clients.

## Versions

rCTF serves V1 and V2 together:

| Version | Prefix | Status | Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| V1 | `/api/v1` | Supported | Legacy clients and compatibility with the original rCTF API. |
| V2 | `/api/v2` | Recommended | New integrations, richer response data, runtime settings, avatars, instancers, admin bot jobs, and admin search APIs. |

Use V2 when it provides the operation you need. Some operations still exist only in V1. Routes shared by both versions usually return the same response `<red>kind</red>`, with V2 adding fields such as avatars, country codes, and blood indices.

## Typed route contract

The `@rctf/types` package exports the public route definitions, responses, enums, and helper types:

```ts showLineNumbers=false
import {
  GetChallengesRouteV2,
  type RouteBodyInput,
  type RouteQueryInput,
  type RouteSuccessResponse,
} from '@rctf/types'

type Query = RouteQueryInput<typeof GetChallengesRouteV2>
type Response = RouteSuccessResponse<typeof GetChallengesRouteV2>
```

`RouteBodyInput<T>{:ts}`, `RouteQueryInput<T>{:ts}`, and `RouteParamsInput<T>{:ts}` provide the input types for the body, query string, and path parameters. They describe values before the server applies Zod conversions.

## Authentication

User-authenticated routes require an auth token in the `Authorization` header:

```text
Authorization: Bearer <auth-token>
```

Admin bot service routes use the same header with the shared secret from `adminBot.provider.options.secretKey` instead of a user token.

| Auth mode | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Public | No token is required. Some public routes still accept optional auth so admins can bypass start-time gates. |
| Optional | The route works without a token, but an auth token may affect the response. |
| Required | A missing or invalid token returns `<response>401 badToken</response>`. |
| Permissioned | The user token must be valid and the user must have every required permission bit. Missing bits return `<response>403 badPerms</response>`. |
| Service | The shared service bearer token must match the configured provider secret. |

### Token types

| Token | Lifetime | Used by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Auth | No expiry | `Authorization: Bearer <auth-token>` on user routes. |
| Team | No expiry | Account recovery and v1 login. V2 registration returns it directly when registration completes without email verification. |
| Verify | `loginTimeout` | Email update verification. |
| CTFtime auth | `loginTimeout` | CTFtime registration and login handoff. |

Tokens are encrypted with AES-GCM using the configured `tokenKey`. Changing `tokenKey` invalidates every token that was issued before the rotation.

## Response format

Most API responses wrap their fields in the following object:

```json
{
  "kind": "goodChallenges",
  "message": "The retrieval of challenges was successful.",
  "data": []
}
```

Responses without additional data omit the `data` field:

```json
{
  "kind": "goodFlag",
  "message": "The flag is correct."
}
```

One typed route does not use this wrapper. `<route>GET /api/v1/integrations/ctftime/leaderboard</route>` returns `{ "standings": [...] }{:json}` directly.

## Request validation

Routes with a JSON body parse JSON, while upload routes parse `multipart/form-data`. Invalid input returns `<response>400 badBody</response>` with a machine-readable `reason`:

```json
{
  "kind": "badBody",
  "message": "The request body does not meet requirements.",
  "data": {
    "reason": "query:limit: Too small: expected number to be >=1"
  }
}
```

The `reason` begins with `body`, `query`, or `params` to identify the source. Malformed JSON returns `<response>400 badJson</response>`. Malformed form data returns `<response>400 badBody</response>` with `body:formData:malformed`.

## Permissions

Admin routes use bitmask permissions from `Permissions{:ts}`:

| Permission | Bit | Routes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `challsRead{:ts}` | `1` | Admin challenge reads, instancer schema, admin bot status, challenge start-time bypass. |
| `challsWrite{:ts}` | `2` | Challenge updates, challenge deletion in v1, file upload. |
| `leaderboardRead{:ts}` | `4` | CTFtime leaderboard and leaderboard start-time bypass. |
| `challsSolveWrite{:ts}` | `8` | Solve deletion. |
| `usersWrite{:ts}` | `16` | Admin user lists, user mutation, pending verification management, submission audit logs. |
| `settingsWrite{:ts}` | `32` | Runtime settings reads and updates. |

When a route lists multiple permission bits, the user needs all of them.

## Timing gates

Routes marked as start-gated return `<response>401 badNotStarted</response>` before `startTime`. Admin users can bypass that gate when the route defines a bypass permission and their token has the required bit.

`<route>POST /api/v1/challs/:id/submit</route>` is also end-gated, returning `<response>401 badEnded</response>` after `endTime`.

## Captcha

Captcha is checked only for actions listed in the provider's protected actions. V1 request bodies use `recaptchaCode`. V2 uses `captchaCode`.

| Action | Routes |
| --- | --- |
| `register{:ts}` | `<route>POST /api/v1/auth/register</route>`, `<route>POST /api/v2/auth/register</route>`. |
| `recover{:ts}` | `<route>POST /api/v1/auth/recover</route>`, `<route>POST /api/v2/auth/recover</route>`. |
| `setEmail{:ts}` | `<route>PUT /api/v1/users/me/auth/email</route>`, `<route>PUT /api/v2/users/me/auth/email</route>`. |
| `avatarUpload{:ts}` | `<route>PATCH /api/v2/users/me/avatar</route>`. |
| `instancerStart{:ts}` | `<route>PUT /api/v2/integrations/challs/:id/instance</route>`. |
| `instancerExtend{:ts}` | `<route>PATCH /api/v2/integrations/challs/:id/instance</route>`. |
| `adminBotSubmit{:ts}` | `<route>POST /api/v2/integrations/challs/:id/admin-bot</route>`. |

## Rate limits

Rate-limited routes return `<response>429 badRateLimit</response>` with `data.timeLeft`, measured in milliseconds:

| Action               | Scope              | Bucket                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Registration email   | IP address         | Burst `20`, refill window `600000` ms. |
| Registration email   | Email address      | Burst `2`, refill window `3600000` ms. |
| Account recovery     | IP address         | Burst `5`, refill window `1500000` ms. |
| Account recovery     | Email address      | Burst `2`, refill window `3600000` ms. |
| Flag submission      | User and challenge | Burst `5`, refill window `25000` ms.   |
| Profile name update  | User               | Burst `3`, refill window `180000` ms.  |
| Email change         | User               | Burst `3`, refill window `900000` ms.  |
| Avatar upload        | User               | Burst `2`, refill window `120000` ms.  |
| Admin bot submission | User and challenge | Burst `1`, refill window `10000` ms.   |
| Leaderboard search   | IP address         | Burst `3`, refill window `3000` ms.    |

Registration uses its buckets only when rCTF would send a verification email. Recovery checks its buckets before looking up the account, so its rate-limit behavior does not reveal whether an email is registered. Both limits apply even when captcha is enabled.
