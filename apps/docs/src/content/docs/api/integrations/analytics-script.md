This route proxies the active analytics provider script when analytics are configured. It is intentionally not part of `@rctf/types`, because it returns JavaScript rather than an rCTF response body.

#### Response

The response body is the provider JavaScript. The API keeps the fetched script in memory for one hour.

When analytics are not configured, the route responds with `404`. Upstream fetch failures respond with `502`.
