::route-meta{def="SubmitDynamicScoresRouteV2"}

Publishes per-team scores for a `dynamic` challenge. The endpoint checks an HMAC signature derived from the challenge's per-instance webhook secret in `<red>scoring.source.secret</red>`. It does not use a user auth token. See [Scoring](/admin/scoring/#dynamic-scoring-guide) for team identifiers and a publisher example.

:::warning[No event-timing gate]

This route accepts scores before `startTime` and after `endTime`. The scoring backend must stop sending updates when the event ends, or later requests will continue to change the final tally.

:::

### Authentication

| Header | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `X-RCTF-Timestamp` | Unix milliseconds at signing time. Must be within a five-minute skew window of the server clock. |
| `X-RCTF-Signature` | `sha256=` followed by the lowercase hex HMAC-SHA256 of `${timestamp}.${challenge_id}.${raw_body}` using the challenge's webhook `secret`. |

Sign the exact bytes sent in the request body. Changes to whitespace, key order, or serialization after signing will make the signature invalid. Include the `:id` path parameter in the signed value, which binds the signature to that challenge.

Unknown challenge IDs, non-dynamic challenges, mismatched signatures, and timestamps outside the skew window all return the same `<response>401 badSignature</response>` so the endpoint can't be probed for which challenges accept a feed.

rCTF also refuses to apply the same delivery twice. Each accepted signature is remembered for ten minutes, and re-sending the same signed bytes to the same challenge within that window returns `<response>409 badReplayedRequest</response>`, so a captured request can't be replayed against the scoreboard.

Only accepted deliveries are remembered, which makes retries safe. If a push fails or the response gets lost, resend the identical signed request. It will either go through or return `<response>409 badReplayedRequest</response>`, confirming that the original attempt was accepted. Retry one attempt at a time, and sign a new request with a fresh timestamp whenever the scores change. Because the challenge ID is part of the signed string, the same payload must be signed separately for each challenge, even when several challenges share a secret.

::request-body{def="SubmitDynamicScoresRouteV2" title="Request body"}

Each entry is an absolute setter for that team and challenge. A `<green>points</green>` value of `0` clears the team's score for the challenge, negative values are accepted, and teams omitted from the payload keep whatever score they already had. Entries for team IDs that don't exist are silently dropped. The response counts only reflect rows that were written.

::response-body{def="SubmitDynamicScoresRouteV2" response="goodDynamicScores" title="Response fields"}

Successful pushes also fire the `leaderboard:force-update` Redis pub/sub message, so a split `<green>frontend</green>` + `<green>leaderboard</green>` deployment still picks up the new scores on the worker's next tick.
