Submits a flag for the authenticated team. This route uses V1 because there is no V2 equivalent.

Rate limit conventions are documented under [`/api#rate-limits`](/api/#rate-limits).

A correct flag returns `<response>200 goodFlag</response>` (no data) and records a solve for the team. A submission is correct when any of the challenge's configured flag entries validates it. The route records a submission audit row for both correct and incorrect attempts; correct rows include which flag entry matched. Admins can read those rows through [`/api/v2/admin/submissions`](/api/admin/).
