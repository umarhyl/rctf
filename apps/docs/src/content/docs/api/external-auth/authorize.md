::route-meta{def="AuthorizeExternalAuthRouteV2"}

Mints a single-use authorization code for the signed-in user and returns the URL the browser should navigate to next. The consent page calls this when the user clicks Authorize.

The `<red>redirectUri</red>` must exactly match the URI registered for the client. Wildcards and path normalization are not supported. A mismatch returns `<response>400 badExternalAuthRequest</response>` without revealing whether the client or URI was wrong.

Banned teams cannot mint codes. When the session token belongs to a banned team, the route returns `<response>403 badPerms</response>`.

Code issuance is rate limited per user with burst `5` and refill window `50000` ms. Exceeding the limit returns `<response>429 badRateLimit</response>` with the wait in `data.timeLeft`.

The returned `<red>redirectTo</red>` appends `code=...` to the registered `<red>redirectUri</red>`, along with `state=...` when the request provides one. It uses `?` or `&` as needed for the registered URI. The code expires from Redis after 60 seconds and is deleted by the first `<route>POST /api/v2/external-auth/token</route>` call.

rCTF returns `<red>state</red>` without reading or changing it. The external service should use this value for CSRF protection.
