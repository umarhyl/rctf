::route-meta{def="ExternalAuthTokenRouteV2"}

The external service's backend exchanges the single-use code for an rCTF auth token. Make this request from a trusted server and never expose the client secret to the browser.

The code can only be exchanged once. Repeated or concurrent requests fail.

:::note[Failures all look identical]

Unknown client, wrong secret, wrong code, expired code, reused code, and code/client mismatch all
  return the same `<response>400 badExternalAuthRequest</response>` body. To debug a failure,
  check the timestamp, current secret, client ID, and exact code sent by the service.

The returned `<red>accessToken</red>` is the same non-expiring token issued at login. Use it in `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>` against any rCTF endpoint. Deleting the client prevents future code exchanges but does not revoke tokens already issued through that client.
