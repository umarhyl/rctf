Returns the same standings data as [current standings](/api/leaderboard/now/), along with graph samples. This is useful when a page renders the standings table and score graph together.

Supports `limit`, `offset`, optional `division`, and optional `search`. Deployment config sets the maximum pagination values, and search values are expected to be 2 to 100 characters.
