title: Docker instancer
description: Deploy the rCTF Docker instancer with the bundled Compose stack and configure Docker-backed instanced challenges.
order: 1
---

The Docker instancer runs per-team challenge services on a standalone Docker host. It creates the containers, networks, volumes, expiration records, and Traefik routes needed for each instance. The bundled Compose deployment includes everything required to run it.

For the participant controls, common `<red>instancerConfig</red>` fields, and available endpoint types, see [Instancer](/integrations/instancer).

## Deployment

The deployment files are in `deploy/docker-instancer/{:dir}`.

:::file-tree
- deploy/
  - docker-instancer/
    - compose.yml Traefik, Redis, and tiny-instancer service
    - .env.example Required environment variables
    - Dockerfile Python 3.14 runtime image
    - conf/ Traefik static and dynamic config
    - certs/ TLS certificate mount point
:::

The Compose stack exposes Traefik on `80{:ts}`, `443{:ts}`, and `1337{:ts}`. The instancer API itself binds to `127.0.0.1:12237` on the host and to `tiny-instancer:1337` inside the `rctf_network` Docker network.

:::warning[Hosting the instancer on a separate machine]
The bundled `compose.yml{:file}` binds the instancer API to `127.0.0.1:12237` because the default deployment expects rCTF and the instancer to share the `rctf_network` Docker network on the same host. The loopback bind is intentional.

If you split the instancer onto its own host (which we recommend, since it isolates challenge workloads from the platform), change the port mapping to bind globally:

```yaml title="deploy/docker-instancer/compose.yml"
ports:
  - '12237:1337'
```

The API is authenticated by a shared `<yellow>AUTH_TOKEN</yellow>`, but the endpoint shouldn't be reachable from anything other than rCTF. Put a host firewall in front of it that only allows the rCTF host's source IP.
:::

The environment file requires shared auth, Redis, and public instance host settings:

```sh title="deploy/docker-instancer/.env"
DEV_ENV=false
BIND_PORT=1337
WEB_WORKERS=1
USE_PROXY_HEADERS=true

AUTH_TOKEN=<shared-secret>
INSTANCES_HOST=instancer.example.com

REDIS_HOST=cache
REDIS_PORT_NUMBER=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=<redis-password>

TRAEFIK_PERMANENT_REDIRECT_MIDDLEWARE_NAME=permanent-https-redirect@file
```

The Docker instancer stack starts from the repository root:

```ansi
$ <red>docker</red> compose <dim>-f</dim> deploy/docker-instancer/compose.yml up <dim>-d</dim>
```

The same token belongs in rCTF:

```yaml title="rctf.d/instancer.yaml"
instancers:
  docker:
    name: instancers/docker
    options:
      apiUrl: http://tiny-instancer:1337
      authToken: <shared-secret>
```

When rCTF is outside the `rctf_network` Docker network, the host-mapped API URL is:

```yaml title="rctf.d/instancer.yaml"
instancers:
  docker:
    name: instancers/docker
    options:
      apiUrl: http://127.0.0.1:12237
      authToken: <shared-secret>
```

Traefik terminates TLS for every `<green>https</green>` and `<green>tcp-ssl</green>` endpoint. Each instance is served at `<hostPrefix>-<uid>.<INSTANCES_HOST>`, so a single wildcard certificate for `*.<INSTANCES_HOST>` covers every per-team instance. The static config (`conf/tls.yml{:file}`) points Traefik at two files in the mounted `certs/{:dir}` directory:

:::file-tree
- deploy/
  - docker-instancer/
    - certs/
      - fullchain.pem Certificate + intermediate chain
      - privkey.pem Private key
:::

Instance hostnames are one label deep, so a single-level wildcard covers every `<hostPrefix>`. Generate the certificate with an ACME client that supports DNS-01, since wildcard certificates cannot use HTTP-01. With Certbot:

```ansi
$ <red>certbot</red> certonly <dim>--manual</dim> <dim>--preferred-challenges</dim> dns <dim>-d</dim> <green>'*.instancer.example.com'</green>
```

Copy the issued files into the mount, matching the names Traefik expects:

```ansi
$ <red>cp</red> /etc/letsencrypt/live/instancer.example.com/fullchain.pem deploy/docker-instancer/certs/fullchain.pem
$ <red>cp</red> /etc/letsencrypt/live/instancer.example.com/privkey.pem deploy/docker-instancer/certs/privkey.pem
```

Traefik loads these at startup and doesn't watch the file config (`watch: false{:yaml}`), so restart the Traefik container after renewing or replacing the certificate.

### Docker daemon address pool

Every instanced challenge creates its own Docker network, so the daemon's default address pool can run out after roughly 30 networks. When that happens, `$ <red>docker</red> network create` fails with `could not find an available, non-overlapping IPv4 address pool`.

Expand the pool by adding the following to `/etc/docker/daemon.json{:file}` on the instancer host:

```json title="/etc/docker/daemon.json"
{
  "default-address-pools": [
    {
      "base": "100.64.0.0/10",
      "size": 24
    }
  ]
}
```

This splits the CGNAT range into 16,384 `/24` networks. Add more pools if your deployment needs additional space.

Restart Docker after editing the file with `$ <red>systemctl</red> restart docker`. Existing networks keep their original ranges.

## Provider options

| Field or variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `<red>options.apiUrl</red>` | Base URL of the Docker instancer API from the rCTF API process. |
| `<red>options.authToken</red>` | Shared token sent when rCTF creates, reads, extends, or deletes an instance. |
| `<yellow>DOCKER_INSTANCER_API_URL</yellow>` | Environment override for `<red>apiUrl</red>`. |
| `<yellow>DOCKER_INSTANCER_AUTH_TOKEN</yellow>` | Environment override for `<red>authToken</red>`. |

:::note[Environment overrides and multiple instancers]
The `<yellow>DOCKER_INSTANCER_*</yellow>` environment variables apply globally, so they're best suited to single-instancer deployments. When you run two Docker instancers, set their `<red>options</red>` inline instead.
:::

## Docker challenge config

The Docker provider accepts a Docker Compose-like object under `<red>config</red>`:

```yaml title="challenge.yaml"
instancerConfig:
  challengeIntegrationId: web-demo
  timeoutMilliseconds: 600000
  extendable: true
  config:
    services:
      app:
        image: ghcr.io/example/web-demo:latest
        environment:
          FLAGS: ${RCTF_FLAGS}
        networks:
          - internal
        expose:
          - '8080'
        read_only: true
        mem_limit: 128m
        cpus: 0.5
        pids_limit: 128
    networks:
      internal:
        internal: true
  expose:
    - kind: https
      hostPrefix: web-demo
      containerName: app
      containerPort: 8080
      title: Challenge
```

The top-level Docker config supports `<red>services</red>`, `<red>networks</red>`, and `<red>volumes</red>`. At least one service is required after defaults are applied.

Each service supports these field groups:

| Fields | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `<red>image</red>` | Docker image. This is required for each explicit service. |
| `<red>hostname</red>`, `<red>environment</red>`, `<red>command</red>`, `<red>entrypoint</red>`, `<red>working_dir</red>`, `<red>user</red>` | Process and runtime metadata. |
| `<red>networks</red>`, `<red>network_mode</red>`, `<red>dns</red>`, `<red>dns_opt</red>`, `<red>dns_search</red>`, `<red>extra_hosts</red>`, `<red>expose</red>` | Network configuration. |
| `<red>volumes</red>`, `<red>tmpfs</red>`, `<red>shm_size</red>`, `<red>read_only</red>` | Filesystem configuration. |
| `<red>privileged</red>`, `<red>security_opt</red>`, `<red>cap_add</red>`, `<red>cap_drop</red>` | Container privilege controls. |
| `<red>mem_limit</red>`, `<red>cpus</red>`, `<red>pids_limit</red>`, `<red>ulimits</red>`, `<red>sysctls</red>` | Resource and kernel limits. |
| `<red>healthcheck</red>`, `<red>labels</red>`, `<red>restart</red>` | Health, metadata, and restart behavior. |

Explicit services default to a read-only root filesystem, `<green>no-new-privileges</green>`, dropped Linux capabilities, `6m` memory, `1.0` CPU, `1024` PIDs, and `nofile` soft and hard limits of `1024`.

Services may only reference networks declared under `<red>config.networks</red>`. Named volume mounts may only reference volumes declared under `<red>config.volumes</red>`. Absolute and relative bind-style mount sources aren't checked against the volume map.

### Network isolation

Services do not join Docker's shared default bridge unless configured to do so. With no `<red>networks</red>`, `<red>expose</red>`, or `<red>network_mode</red>`, a service gets `<red>network_mode: none</red>`.

When several challenge services need to communicate, declare a user-defined network with `<red>internal: true</red>` and attach each service to it. They can then reach one another without reaching the host or internet. Use `<red>network_mode: bridge</red>` only when the service specifically needs Docker's default bridge.

## Per-team flags and hostnames

At instance-creation time the instancer substitutes placeholders in service `<red>environment</red>` values with the team's flags and the instance hostnames. Reference a placeholder to opt a service in:

```yaml title="challenge.yaml"
instancerConfig:
  config:
    services:
      app:
        image: ghcr.io/example/web-demo:latest
        environment:
          RCTF_FLAG: ${RCTF_FLAG}
          RCTF_FLAGS: ${RCTF_FLAGS}
          RCTF_EXPOSED_HOSTNAMES: ${RCTF_EXPOSED_HOSTNAMES}
```

| Placeholder | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `<yellow>RCTF_FLAG</yellow>` | The first configured flag as a plain string, or an empty string when the challenge has no flags. Same value as the `<red>rctf.osec.io/flag</red>` annotation on the [Kubernetes instancer](/integrations/instancer/kubernetes#the-flags-inside-pods). |
| `<yellow>RCTF_FLAGS</yellow>` | JSON list with one entry per configured flag, each shaped as `{"provider": "flags/static", "flag": "..."}{:json}`, for the team that started the instance. Same shape as the `<red>rctf.osec.io/flags</red>` annotation on the [Kubernetes instancer](/integrations/instancer/kubernetes#the-flags-inside-pods). |
| `<yellow>RCTF_EXPOSED_HOSTNAMES</yellow>` | JSON list with one entry per `<red>expose</red>` item, each shaped as `{"kind", "hostPrefix", "host", "port", "containerName", "containerPort", "title"?}{:json}`. Same shape as the `<red>rctf.osec.io/exposed-hostnames</red>` annotation on the Kubernetes instancer. Hidden endpoints (`shouldDisplay: false{:yml}`) are included, and `<green>tcp</green>` exposes appear as `<green>tcp-ssl</green>` since that is how they're routed. |

Both `$RCTF_FLAGS` and `${RCTF_FLAGS}` forms substitute. Substitution is applied per value: only values that reference at least one of the placeholders above are processed, and every other value is delivered byte-for-byte unchanged, so literal `$` sequences in passwords or connection strings are safe. Within a processed value, unknown placeholders such as `${OTHER}` pass through untouched.
