description: Configure email delivery with SMTP, Amazon SES, Postmark, or Mailgun.

Email providers send verification and recovery emails. You need one configured if you want email-based registration, account recovery, or email changes to work.

:::tip[What we use in practice]
We usually use [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com/) for events including Malta CTF, idek CTF, DiceCTF, and SekaiCTF. SES is inexpensive at higher volume when the event already uses AWS. SMTP works with any mail service that provides credentials, and Mailgun is another hosted option. Account limits and existing infrastructure usually matter more than the provider itself.
:::

## Configuration

Configure a provider and sender address. You can also add an email-specific logo:

```yaml
email:
  provider:
    name: emails/smtp
    options:
      smtpUrl: smtp://user:password@mail.example.com:587
  from: noreply@example.com
  logoUrl: https://example.com/email-logo.png # Optional
```

When `<red>email.logoUrl</red>` is unset, emails use the top-level `<red>logoLightUrl</red>` and `<red>logoDarkUrl</red>` values instead. The logo can also be set with the `<yellow>RCTF_EMAIL_LOGO_URL</yellow>` environment variable.

:::note
Without an email provider, registration skips verification, account recovery is unavailable, and email-based division ACLs cannot be enforced.
:::

Registration and recovery emails are [rate limited](/api#rate-limits) by client IP and destination address, with or without captcha. Configure [proxy trust](/configuration#proxy) correctly so the limiter sees the participant's IP rather than the proxy's.
