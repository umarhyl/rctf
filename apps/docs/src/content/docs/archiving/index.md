The `$ <red>rctf</red> export` command of the [rctf CLI](/admin/cli) turns a running rCTF instance into a read-only static site. It preserves challenges, profiles, solves, the leaderboard, and uploaded files without requiring a database or API server.

## CLI

The exporter reads from a live rCTF API and copies a built SvelteKit frontend. Build the frontend first, then run the export command:

```ansi
$ <red>bun</red> run <dim>--filter</dim> <green>'@rctf/web'</green> build
$ <red><dim>bun</dim> rctf</red> export <dim>\</dim>
  <dim>--api-url</dim> https://ctf.example.com <dim>\</dim>
  <dim>--backend</dim> cloudflare-pages <dim>\</dim>
  <dim>--output</dim> ./export-output
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<dim>--api-url</dim>` | required | Base URL of the live rCTF instance to crawl. |
| `<dim>--backend</dim>` | required | Target host. One of `<green>cloudflare-pages</green>` or `<green>github-pages</green>`. |
| `<dim>--web-build</dim>` | `apps/web/build/{:dir}` | Pre-built SvelteKit frontend that is copied into the output. |
| `<dim>--output</dim>` | `./export-output/{:dir}` | Destination directory. Wiped and recreated on every run. |
| `<dim>--concurrency</dim>` | `5{:ts}` | Concurrent in-flight API requests during the discovery phase. |
| `<dim>--skip-uploads</dim>` | off | Skips downloading challenge files and avatars. URL rewriting is skipped with it. |

The output directory is deleted before each run. Point `<dim>--output</dim>` somewhere that does not contain other files.

## What the exporter collects

The discovery phase fetches:

- `/api/v2/integrations/client/config` with `<red>isArchived</red>` patched to `true{:ts}`.
- `/api/v2/challs` and `/api/v2/leaderboard/challs`.
- The full leaderboard and graph, paginated and merged into a single `api-data/v2/leaderboard/dump.json{:file}`.
- One `/api/v2/users/:id` response per unique user seen on the leaderboard.
- Every challenge's paginated solves, merged into one `api-data/v2/challs/:id/solves.json{:file}` per challenge.
- A static `<response>401 badToken</response>` stub for `/api/v2/users/me` so the frontend stays in a logged-out state.

Unless `<dim>--skip-uploads</dim>` is set, the exporter downloads challenge files, avatars, sponsor icons, the favicon, logos, and the OG image. Files already under `/uploads/` keep that path. Files from S3, Discord, and other external hosts are stored under `uploads/external/<hash>/<filename>{:file}`. The saved JSON responses are updated to use the local copies.

## Output layout

The resulting directory is ready to upload to a static host:

:::file-tree
- export-output/
  - index.html SvelteKit shell with the fetch interceptor injected
  - 404.html Copy of index.html for SPA fallback
  - index.html.gz
  - index.html.br
  - _app/ SvelteKit build assets
  - api-data/ Static API responses
    - v2/
      - challs.json
      - leaderboard/
        - dump.json Full leaderboard + graph for client-side filtering
      - users/
        - [id].json
      - challs/
        - [id]/
          - solves.json
  - uploads/ Mirrored /uploads/ and uploads/external/[hash]/
  - _redirects cloudflare-pages only
  - _headers cloudflare-pages only
  - wrangler.toml cloudflare-pages only
  - .nojekyll github-pages only
:::

The exporter removes the `Content-Security-Policy{:http}` meta tag from `index.html{:file}` because the static archive injects an inline request interceptor.

## Deployment

The exporter prints the matching deploy command on success.

::::tabs
:::tab[Cloudflare Pages]
The `cloudflare-pages` backend writes:

- `_redirects{:file}` with `/* /index.html 200` so SvelteKit's client-side routes resolve.
- `_headers{:file}` setting `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable{:http}` on `/api-data/*`, `/uploads/*`, and `/_app/*`, plus `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *{:http}` on `/api-data/*`.
- `wrangler.toml{:file}` with a placeholder `name = "rctf-archive"` and `pages_build_output_dir = "."`. Edit the name before deploying.

Deploy from the output directory:

```ansi
$ <red>npx</red> <red>wrangler</red> pages deploy ./export-output
```
:::
:::tab[GitHub Pages]
The `github-pages` backend writes an empty `.nojekyll{:file}` so files under `_app/{:dir}` are served instead of being filtered by Jekyll.

Publish with `$ <red>gh-pages</red>` from the repository root. The `<dim>--dotfiles</dim>` flag is required so `.nojekyll{:file}` is uploaded:

```ansi
$ <red>npx</red> <red>gh-pages</red> <dim>-d</dim> ./export-output <dim>--dotfiles</dim>
```

Pages served from a project subpath (`username.github.io/repo`) need a custom domain or root deployment, since the injected interceptor and SvelteKit build both assume the site is served from `/`.
:::
::::

## Runtime behavior

The injected script wraps `window.fetch{:ts}` and routes `/api/*` calls through static files:

- Any non-`<route>GET</route>` request returns `<response>405 Method Not Allowed</response>` with `"kind": "badEndpoint"{:json}` and the message `"This is a read-only archive."{:json}`. Login, registration, flag submission, profile edits, and admin actions all fail with this response.
- `/api/v2/leaderboard/with-graph`, `/api/v2/leaderboard/now`, and `/api/v2/leaderboard/graph` are answered from `dump.json{:file}` with in-memory `<red>division</red>` filtering, `<red>search</red>` substring matching, and `<red>offset</red>` / `<red>limit</red>` slicing. The scoreboard stays searchable without a backend.
- `/api/v2/challs/:id/solves` is sliced from each challenge's `solves.json{:file}`.
- `/api/v2/integrations/analytics/script` returns an empty `<response>404</response>` so the archived bundle does not ping a third-party analytics provider.
- Every other `/api/*` `<route>GET</route>` is rewritten to `/api-data/<path>.json{:file}` and served from the static bundle. Missing files return a `<response>404 badEndpoint</response>`.

When `<red>isArchived</red>` is set, the frontend hides flag submission, profile editing, account creation, and other interactive controls.

## Limitations

:::warning[Read-only by design]
The archive contains every JSON response the exporter saw at crawl time. Anything that requires authentication, server state, or live computation is absent.
:::

- No login, registration, password recovery, or token issuance. `/api/v2/users/me` always returns `<response>401 badToken</response>`.
- No admin pages. Admin endpoints require an authenticated session that the archive cannot produce.
- No live updates. The leaderboard reflects the moment the exporter ran. Re-run the export to refresh.
- No instancer, admin bot, or CTFtime export. Those depend on the live API and external services.
- Captcha, analytics, and any other integration that calls back to the API or a third party is disabled.

To refresh the snapshot, run the exporter again while the live instance is still available. Each run rebuilds the output directory from scratch.
