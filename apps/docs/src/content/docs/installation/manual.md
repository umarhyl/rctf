description: Set up rCTF from source for development or custom deployments.
order: 1
---

This guide covers setting up rCTF from source without Docker, suitable for development or environments where you need full control over the stack.

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) 1.2 or later
- PostgreSQL 15+
- Redis 7+

## Project structure

rCTF is a (mostly) Bun monorepo with the following layout:

:::file-tree
- apps/
  - api/ Hono REST API server
  - web/ SvelteKit frontend (static build)
  - admin-bot/ Puppeteer-based admin bot service
  - k8s-operator/ Kubernetes challenge instancer (Go)
  - docker-instancer/ Docker challenge instancer (Python)
  - docs/ Documentation site
  - cli/ Operational CLI
- packages/
  - config/ YAML/JSON config loader with Zod validation
  - db/ Drizzle ORM schema and migrations
  - scoring/ Pluggable scoring algorithms
  - types/ Shared route definitions and validators
  - util/ Small shared utilities
:::

## Setup

::::steps
1. **Clone and install dependencies**

   ```ansi
   $ <red>git</red> clone https://github.com/otter-sec/rctf.git
   $ <red>cd</red> rctf
   $ <red>bun</red> i
   ```

2. **Create a configuration directory**

   rCTF loads configuration from a `rctf.d/{:dir}` directory. Files inside it (YAML or JSON) are loaded alphabetically and deep-merged. Create one with `$ <red>mkdir</red> rctf.d` at the project root.

   :::file-tree
   - rctf.d/
     - **01-base.yaml** create this next
   :::

   Create a minimal configuration file:

   ```yaml title="rctf.d/01-base.yaml" showLineNumbers
   ctfName: My CTF
   origin: https://ctf.example.com
   tokenKey: <dim><base64-encoded-32-byte-key></dim>

   database:
     sql: postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/rctf
     redis: redis://localhost:6379
     migrate: before

   startTime: 1735689600000
   endTime: 1735776000000

   divisions:
     open: Open
   ```

   :::tip[Generating a token key]
   The `<red>tokenKey</red>` must be a base64-encoded 32-byte random key used for AES-GCM token encryption. Generate one with `$ <red>openssl</red> rand <dim>-base64</dim> 32`.
   :::

   You can also set configuration values through environment variables. See [Configuration](/configuration) for the full reference.

3. **Run database migrations**

   ```ansi
   $ <red>bun</red> run db:migrate
   ```

   Alternatively, set `<red>database.migrate</red>` to `<green>before</green>` in your config to run migrations automatically on startup.

4. **Start the development servers**

   ```ansi
   $ <red>bun</red> dev
   ```

   This starts both the API server on `http://127.0.0.1:3000` and the SvelteKit dev server on `http://127.0.0.1:5173`. The dev server proxies API requests to the backend.

   To run them separately:

   ```ansi
   $ <red>bun</red> run dev:api   <dim># API only on :3000</dim>
   $ <red>bun</red> run dev:web   <dim># Frontend only on :5173</dim>
   ```

   :::tip[One-shot dev setup]
   For a fresh local environment, `$ <red>bun</red> run dev:mock` runs the migrations, resets and seeds the database, and starts the development servers. The seed includes an admin, 1000 teams, 38 challenges, and sample solves and submissions. The console prints login URLs for the admin and one team.
   :::
::::

## Production build

For production deployments, use our prebuilt Docker images rather than running a source build by hand. The image bundles the API, the compiled leaderboard worker, and the static frontend, and it runs Drizzle migrations on boot:

```yaml
image: ghcr.io/otter-sec/rctf:latest
```

See [Quick start with Docker](/installation/) for the full Compose setup. The manual build above is intended for development. If you run `bun` directly in production, you also need to manage the build, leaderboard worker, and reverse proxy that the image normally handles.

## Scaling

The `<red>instanceType</red>` config option lets you split an rCTF process into `<green>frontend</green>`-only or `<green>leaderboard</green>`-only roles for horizontal scaling. See [Scaling](/installation/scaling) for the full table.

## Running tests

Tests use PGlite (in-process PostgreSQL) and ioredis-mock, so no external services are needed:

```ansi
$ <red>bun</red> run test                 <dim># Run all tests from root</dim>
$ <red>bun</red> run test:server:coverage <dim># Server tests with coverage</dim>
$ <red>bun</red> run typecheck            <dim># Typecheck all workspaces</dim>
```
