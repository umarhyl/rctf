title: Upgrading from v1
description: Migration guide from rCTF v1 to v2, covering database changes, API differences, and configuration updates.
order: 2
---

This guide explains the v1 to v2 upgrade and lists the database, API, and configuration changes.

## In short, swap the image and restart

The upgrade is automated. Point your existing deployment at the v2 image and start it. Drizzle migrations run on boot, and rCTF converts the v1 `<red>recaptcha</red>` / `<red>globalSiteTag</red>` config to the v2 format at startup. You do not need to run SQL or rewrite the config first.

```yaml title="compose.yml"
services:
  rctf:
    image: ghcr.io/otter-sec/rctf:latest
```

:::warning[Back up the database first]
Migrations are forward-only and modify the schema in place. Take a PostgreSQL dump, for example with `$ <red>pg_dump</red>`, before swapping the image so you have a way back if something goes wrong.
:::

## Database migration

Set `<red>database.migrate</red>` to `<green>before</green>` to run Drizzle migrations during startup. The bundled deployment already does this. The schema default is `<green>never</green>`, so custom deployments must enable migrations or run them manually:

```ansi
$ <red>bun</red> run db:migrate
```

### New tables

| Table            | Purpose                                                                    |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `settings`       | Stores runtime-editable settings (CTF name, client timing, sponsors, etc.) |

### New columns on `users`

| Column                   | Type      | Description                          |
| ------------------------ | --------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `avatar_url`             | text      | URL to user's avatar image           |
| `country_code`           | text      | ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code      |
| `status_text`            | text      | User status message (max 60 chars)   |
| `score`                  | integer   | Cached current score                 |
| `global_rank`            | integer   | Cached global leaderboard rank       |

| `last_solve_at`          | timestamp | Time of last solve (for tiebreaking) |
| `last_tiebreak_solve_at` | timestamp | Time of last tiebreak-eligible solve |

### New columns on `challenges`

| Column        | Type    | Description                    |
| ------------- | ------- | ------------------------------ |
| `score`       | integer | Cached current challenge score |
| `solve_count` | integer | Cached number of solves        |

## API changes

All v1 routes still work. V2 routes use the `/api/v2/...` prefix and include the following changes.

### Captcha field rename

V2 routes use `<red>captchaCode</red>` instead of `<red>recaptchaCode</red>` in request bodies. This applies to every endpoint that supports captcha validation.

### File uploads

The v2 admin upload endpoint (`<route>POST /api/v2/admin/upload</route>`) takes binary files via `multipart/form-data` rather than the base64-encoded data URIs v1 used.

### New v2 endpoints

| Endpoint | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `<route>GET /v2/auth/verify-info</route>` | Returns info about a verification token |
| `<route>GET /v2/leaderboard/challs</route>` | Challenge metadata with first 3 solvers per challenge |
| `<route>GET /v2/leaderboard/with-graph</route>` | Combined leaderboard and graph in one request |
| `<route>PATCH /v2/users/me/avatar</route>` | Upload and moderate avatar images |
| `<route>GET/POST /v2/admin/users</route>` | List all users with search, filters, and pagination |
| `<route>GET/PUT /v2/admin/settings</route>` | Runtime settings management |
| `<route>POST /v2/admin/users/:id/token</route>` | Generate login token for a team |
| `<route>DELETE /v2/admin/challs/:id/solves/:userId</route>` | Delete a specific solve |
| `<route>GET /v2/admin/instancer/schema</route>` | Instancer config JSON schema |
| `<route>GET/POST /v2/admin/admin-bot/*</route>` | Admin bot job management |
| `<route>GET/PUT/PATCH/DELETE /v2/integrations/challs/:id/instance</route>` | Challenge instance lifecycle |
| `<route>GET/POST /v2/integrations/challs/:id/admin-bot/*</route>` | Admin bot submission and status |

### Response differences

- Challenge files in v2 include a `size` field (v1 did not track file sizes)
- Challenge solves in v2 include user profile data (avatar, country, status) and blood status
- Leaderboard in v2 supports a `search` query parameter for team name search (rate limited)

## Configuration changes

### Captcha provider

rCTF converts the v1 `<red>recaptcha</red>` block at startup, but new configuration should use `<red>captcha.provider</red>`:

::::tabs
:::tab[v1 (deprecated)]
```yaml title="v1"
recaptcha:
  siteKey: your-site-key
  secretKey: your-secret-key
  protectedActions:
    - register
```
:::
:::tab[v2 (recommended)]
```yaml title="v2"
captcha:
  provider:
    name: captcha/recaptcha
    options:
      siteKey: your-site-key
      secretKey: your-secret-key
  protectedEndpoints:
    - register
```
:::
::::

The new format also supports `<green>captcha/hcaptcha</green>` and `<green>captcha/turnstile</green>` providers.

### Analytics provider

rCTF also converts `<red>globalSiteTag</red>` automatically. Its v2 replacement is:

```yaml title="v2 (recommended)"
analytics:
  provider:
    name: analytics/google
    options:
      siteTag: G-XXXXXXXX
```

Additional analytics providers are also available, such as `<green>analytics/cloudflare</green>`.

### New configuration sections

v2 adds the following configuration sections:

| Section                        | Purpose                                      |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `<red>adminBot</red>`          | Admin bot provider and settings              |
| `<red>avatarsModeration</red>` | Avatar content moderation (OpenAI)           |
| `<red>bloodBot</red>`          | First blood notifications (Discord/Telegram) |
| `<red>analytics</red>`         | Analytics provider                           |
| `<red>proxy</red>`             | Reverse proxy and Cloudflare settings        |
| `<red>maxAvatarSize</red>`     | Maximum avatar upload size (default 1 MB)    |

See the [Configuration](/configuration) reference for details on every option.
