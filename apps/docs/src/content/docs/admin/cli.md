title: CLI
description: Operational command-line tool for deployment tasks, managing admin permissions, seeding demo data, and exporting archives.
order: 8
---

The `<red>rctf</red>` CLI bundles rCTF's operational tooling: deployment helpers, admin management, database seeding, and static exports.

## Invocation

From a source checkout, run it through the root script:

```ansi
$ <red><dim>bun</dim> rctf</red> user list-admins
```

The production Docker image includes `<red>rctf</red>` on `<yellow>PATH</yellow>`, so commands can run inside the container next to the live instance:

```ansi
$ <red>docker</red> exec rctf-rctf-1 <red>rctf</red> user list-admins
```

The CLI reads the same `rctf.d/{:dir}` configuration as the API, or the directory set by `<yellow>RCTF_CONF_PATH</yellow>`, and talks to the database and Redis directly.

## Commands

### `<red>rctf</red> config get`

Prints the resolved value at a dot-separated [configuration](/configuration) path.

```ansi
$ <red><dim>bun</dim> rctf</red> config get database.migrate
before
$ <red><dim>bun</dim> rctf</red> config get leaderboard.maxLimit
100
```

### `<red>rctf</red> user promote`

Grants permissions to the user with the given email. Without `<dim>--perms</dim>`, the command grants full admin access.

```ansi
$ <red><dim>bun</dim> rctf</red> user promote admin@example.com
$ <red><dim>bun</dim> rctf</red> user promote author@example.com <dim>--perms</dim> challsRead,challsWrite
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<dim>--perms</dim>` | all permissions | Comma-separated [permission names](/admin#permissions). |

### `<red>rctf</red> user demote`

Resets a user's permissions to zero.

```ansi
$ <red><dim>bun</dim> rctf</red> user demote author@example.com
```

### `<red>rctf</red> user list-admins`

Lists every user holding any permissions.

### `<red>rctf</red> seed`

Wipes the database and fills it with demo data.

```ansi
$ <red><dim>bun</dim> rctf</red> seed
```

:::warning
Seeding deletes all users, challenges, solves, submissions, and settings. When `<yellow>NODE_ENV</yellow>=<green>production</green>`, the command refuses to run unless `<dim>--force</dim>` is passed.
:::

### `<red>rctf</red> export`

Exports a static, read-only archive of a running instance. See [Static export](/archiving) for the full flag reference.

### `<red>rctf</red> deployment generate-csp`

Generates nginx security-header directives from the current configuration and outputs it to stdout. The output includes a provider-aware `Content-Security-Policy{:http}` header plus `Referrer-Policy{:http}`, `X-Frame-Options{:http}`, and `X-Content-Type-Options{:http}`. The command reads Svelte's generated CSP directives from `<dim>--web-build</dim>` (default: `apps/web/build/{:dir}`), merges them with the runtime policy and any extra sources from the [`<red>csp</red>` config option](/configuration#csp), and removes duplicate sources.

The production container runs this command automatically at startup.

### `<red>rctf</red> deployment generate-avatar-body-limit`

Generates a nginx `client_max_body_size{:nginx}` directive for the avatar upload endpoint and outputs it to stdout. The limit is the [`<red>maxAvatarSize</red>` config option](/configuration#limits) plus headroom for the multipart request framing, so the proxy never rejects uploads the API would accept.

The production container runs this command automatically at startup.
